  # Multi-User Full-Stack Todo Web Application - Hackathon II Phase 2

  Target audience: Hackathon judges evaluating strict Spec-Driven Development, TDD compliance, reusable intelligence via subagents/skills, security enforcement, UI/UX excellence, and overall implementation quality; Panaversity team assessing AI-native development capability and startup founder potential

  Focus: Deliver a complete, production-ready, multi-user Todo web application using strict Spec-Driven Development with Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus, featuring persistent Neon PostgreSQL storage, secure Better Auth JWT authentication with full user isolation, responsive modern dashboard with glassmorphism and 60fps animations, and implementation of all Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced Todo feature levels

  Success criteria:
  - Fully implements all Basic Level features: Add Task, Delete Task, Update Task, View Task List, Mark as Complete
  - Fully implements all Intermediate Level features: Priorities & Tags/Categories (high/medium/low + custom labels), Search & Filter (by keyword, status, priority, duedate), Sort Tasks (by due date, priority, alphabetical)
  - Fully implements all Advanced Level features: Recurring Tasks (daily/weekly/monthly auto-reschedule), Due Dates & Time Reminders (date/time picker + browser notifications)
  - Enforces strict multi-user isolation via Better Auth + JWT: all protected API endpoints require valid token, verify user_id matching, return 401 Unauthorized for missing/invalid tokens, 403 Forbidden for cross-user access attempts
  - Achieves mandatory test coverage via strict TDD: Backend 80%+ overall / 100% for auth & security, Frontend 70%+ overall / 90%+ for critical components, E2E 100% for key user flows (signup, login, task CRUD, recurring, notifications)
  - Demonstrates reusable intelligence through defined subagents (Frontend, Backend, Authentication, Code Reviewer & Implementer, TDD-Testing) and skills with iterative delegation and refinement (+200 bonus target)
  - Produces polished, responsive dashboard UI using Next.js 15+ App Router, shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS (no inline styles), glassmorphism cards, dark mode (next-themes), 60fps GSAP/Framer Motion animations, WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
  - Fully deployable application: Frontend on Vercel or Github pages, Backend on Hugging Face Spaces, Neon PostgreSQL live.

  Constraints:
  - Zero manual coding permitted: All code must be generated by Claude Code from approved Markdown specifications; any issue resolved exclusively through spec refinement and regeneration
  - Strict TDD required: Red-Green-Refactor cycle mandatory; no production code written without preceding failing test
  - Locked technology stack: Frontend (Next.js 15+ App Router, TypeScript strict, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, GSAP + Framer Motion, next-themes); Backend (UV package manager, Python 3.13+, FastAPI, SQLModel, Better Auth JWT with shared BETTER_AUTH_SECRET); Database (Neon Serverless PostgreSQL)
  - Monorepo must follow Spec-Kit Plus structure: .spec-kit/config.yaml, organized /specs/ (overview, features/, api/, database/, ui/, testing/), root/frontend/backend CLAUDE.md files, history/prompts/ for PHRs
  - All API endpoints follow /api/{user_id}/tasks pattern with mandatory JWT protection and user ownership enforcement
  - UI must implement glassmorphism, mobile-first responsive design, subtle high-performance animations, and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

  Not building:
  - Phase III AI-powered chatbot features (OpenAI ChatKit, Agents SDK, Official MCP SDK)
  - Phase IV/V cloud-native deployments (Minikube, Helm Charts, Kafka, Dapr, DigitalOcean Kubernetes)
  - Any elements from Phase I in-memory console application
  - Native mobile applications or non-web clients
  - Vendor comparisons or ethical AI discussions
